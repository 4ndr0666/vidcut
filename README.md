## Supported Formats

Since Vid-Cut is based on Chromium core and HTML5 video player, not all ffmpeg supported formats are supported directly. In order to use this application faster and smoother, the following formats/codecs should generally be imported: MP4, MOV, WebM, MKV, OGG, WAV, MP3, AAC, H264, Theora, VP8, VP9\. Related for more information on Chromium's supported formats/codecs, see <https://www.chromium.org/audio-videoã€‚>

For formats not supported by Chromium, Vid-Cut uses fast real-time transcoding and playback technology, which allows play all videos which ffmpeg can be decoded, and the cut result is still lossless. But unfortunately, especially in the case of large video files, the efficiency of this method (accurately in terms of tracking fluency) is still not the same as the native support format.
